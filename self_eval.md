# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

I feel completely confident

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

I feel completely confident

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

Is the only way to ensure no user error happens when inputting arguments through conditionals?
For example, if I only string is the only acceptable datatype for a method parameter, would one have
to put a conditional checking if the argument passed through is a string? Is there a way
to set the parameter's datatype in the method definition? This becomes especially important
for methods with multiple parameters that need to be different datatypes.
